# Google-Assistant-Control-with-Adafruit-Ifttt Project


The idea behind Google assistant-controlled Home automation is to control home devices withvoice. On the market there are many devices available to do that, but making our own is awesome. In thisproject, the Google assistant requires voice commands. Adafruit account which is a cloud based free IoTweb server used to create virtual switches, is linking to IFTTT website abbreviated as “If This Then That” which is used to create if else conditional statements. The voice commands for Google assistant have been
added through IFTTT website. In this home automation, as the user gives commands to the Google assistant, Home appliances like Bulb, Fan and Motor etc., can be controlled accordingly. The commands given through the Google assistant are decoded and then sent to the microcontroller, the microcontroller inturn control the relays connected to it. The device connected to the respective relay can be turned On orOFF as per the users request to the Google Assistant. The microcontroller used is NodeMCU (ESP8266)
and the communication between the microcontroller and the application is established via Wi-Fi (Internet).
